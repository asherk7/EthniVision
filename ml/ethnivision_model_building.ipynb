    "In this notebook, we will explore the process of building a neural network model to predict ethnicities, age, and gender based on certain features. Predicting ethnicities, age, and gender can have various applications, including demographic analysis, social studies, and more. We will follow a step-by-step approach, covering data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and interpretation."
